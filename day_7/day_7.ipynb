    "You thank the cephalopods for the help and exit the trash compactor, finding yourself in the familiar halls of a North Pole research wing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the large sign that says \"teleporter hub\", they seem to be researching teleportation; you can't help but try it for yourself and step onto the large yellow teleporter pad.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suddenly, you find yourself in an unfamiliar room! The room has no doors; the only way out is the teleporter. Unfortunately, the teleporter seems to be leaking magic smoke.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this is a teleporter lab, there are lots of spare parts, manuals, and diagnostic equipment lying around. After connecting one of the diagnostic tools, it helpfully displays error code 0H-N0, which apparently means that there's an issue with one of the tachyon manifolds.\n",
    "\n",
    "You quickly locate a diagram of the tachyon manifold (your puzzle input). A tachyon beam enters the manifold at the location marked S; tachyon beams always move downward. Tachyon beams pass freely through empty space (.). However, if a tachyon beam encounters a splitter (^), the beam is stopped; instead, a new tachyon beam continues from the immediate left and from the immediate right of the splitter.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
